            Stuff about me
        </h2>
        <p>
            <div id="About">
                My journey to find computer science was not quite typical. I entered college with a mindset of becoming
                a pediatric dentist and majored in Child Learning and Development. After my graduation, I started
                studying for the DAT exam. After spending numerous hours studying for the DAT exam and volunteering at a
                dental office, I realized this is not for me. I was more interested in inventing and building solutions.
                During the pandemic, I heard my brother talking about all the cool companies and projects he worked on
                as a Software Engineering major, and I was awestruck. I was inspired, so I started taking courses from
                the University of Michigan on HTML, CSS, and Java and found my passion. But, let's be real, those
                classes were tough, especially for someone like me, who was coming from psychology and dental
                background. After investing hours in a particularly difficult program, when I was finally able to see
                the work, it was so satisfying! My dedication and hard work paid off and that motivated me to keep
                going. <br>
                <br>
                I learned as I went, and building the website proved to be such a rewarding experience that I decided to
                pursue a degree in computer science. I am currently a Junior at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am
                always searching for ways on how to use computational processes to build websites, mine data, and much
                more. One of my goals is to bridge the gender gap in the computing field. I hope to make a positive
                difference in the world one day!
